## B

### Biometric Authentication
A security process that relies on unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints or facial recognition to verify identity.

## C

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
A method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. SafwaanBuddy uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Conversational AI
AI technology that enables natural, human-like interactions between computers and humans through text or voice.

## D

### Debug APK
An Android application package built for development and testing purposes, containing debugging information and not optimized for production.

### Dependency Injection
A design pattern that implements inversion of control for software libraries, where dependencies are provided to classes rather than hard-coded.

## E

### Encryption
The process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. SafwaanBuddy uses AES-256 encryption for sensitive health data.

### End-to-End Encryption
A system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages, preventing potential eavesdroppers from accessing data.

## G

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform provided by GitHub that allows you to automate your software development workflows.

### Gradle

Technology that converts written text into spoken language. Used in SafwaanBuddy for voice responses.

## V

### ViewModel
An Android architecture component designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## W

### WorkManager
An Android library that makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or device restarts.

## T

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)
Technology that converts written text into spoken language. Used in SafwaanBuddy for voice responses.

## U
